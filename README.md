## "How did you made this project?"

To be able to do this project I used tools such as:

<table align='center'>
  <thead>
    <th>Technology</th>
    <th>Framework/Library</th>
  </thead>
  
  <tbody>
    <tr align='center'>
      <td>HTML</td>
      <td>Emmet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr align='center'>
      <td>CSS</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr align='center'>
      <td>JavaScript</td>
      <td>
        jQuery
        <br>
        React
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
